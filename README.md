# Progress-Steps-with-JavaScript-and-CSS

I created a Progress Steps project

You typically see this in different websites with forms, usually multi-level forms, shopping carts, etc.

It consists of buttons to control the steps. eg. 1-4

The step starts at 1 and consists of 2 buttons: Previous and Next to navigate through the page

It starts at 1 and when the Next button is clicked, it will jump to the next page, (2nd page) and so on.

When you press the PREVIOUS button, it goes back to the previous page as well.

I disabled the PREV button upon reaching the very last page and disabled the NEXT button upon reaching the very first page.
